# Squirt Programming Language

## Welcome To Squirt

Squirt is a easy-to-use programming language. It has a simple and clean syntax, make you easy to code more.

It is inspired by Not only Python, Javascript and Scala, but also C and C++. Especially, highly affected by Javascript. However, Javascript can express in variety of ways, Squirt which pursue simplicity expresses in one way.

Squirt now only support `i64`, `boolean`. `array`, `hash` is supposed to be supported while `f64` is not.

Implementation Written in Rust. So, to compile REPL console, you have to use `rustc`.

## Contributing to Squirt

Squirt Programming Language is developed for educational purpose.

Contributions to Squirt are welcomed and encouraged to who learn Compiler! To give clarity of what code is expected, We'll adopt code convention document in near future.

## Getting Started

```
$ cargo run
```

Rust2018 is needed.

### Build Failures

Try the suggestions in Troubleshooting build issues.

Make sure you are using the correct environment for `rustc`.

## Learning More

We'll add Documents for Squirt Language Grammar.

So, Stay tuned.
